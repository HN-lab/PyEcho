In this example you can see an additional file titled: "error\_file.txt".  
*This file tells the user if they have not specified enough source wells for a particular reagent.*  
If an error has been generated, the user can refer to the "reagent\_well\_volumes.csv" file for more information about missing wells. The volume of reagent to be added to each source well is mentioned in this file. The unspecified wells would be mentioned as a blank cell.
